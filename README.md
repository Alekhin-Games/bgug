[Break Guns Using Gems](https://fireslime.xyz/games/bgug) is an open-source mobile game for Android and iOS.

It's a fast paced side-scrolling platformer with innovative controls and and a gun-related twist.

Developed by the [Fireslime Team](https://fireslime.xyz) using [flame](https://flame-engine.org).

This is also a good, complete example and showcase of all flame has to offer. Please check this source code if you have advanced questions about flame.

## Gameplay

BGUG puts you in control of a tiny robot, in his quest to avoid obstacles and collect gems.

Use the gems to block the pathway of the guns that try to kill you and see how much you can endure the tireless obstacles in this endless runner.

Collect coins on your adventure and by blocking the guns, then use those coins to buy awesome custom skin for your tiny robot, choosing between a total of more than 30 skins available.

Hold the left side of the screen to jump; the longer you hold, the higher you'll jump upon release. Hold the right of the screen to fall quicker after your jumps.

Simple but innovative and hard-to-master controls keep you in the flow in order to improve after every death. Become the best among your friends and get all the achievements!

Also check out the playground with no coin rewards but 100% customizable options. Make your own game with the abundant configs.

## Running

You can download from [the store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=xyz.luan.bgug) or build yourself. After clonning, just run the build script to both fetch dependencies and build the generated files:

```bash
./cmds/build.sh
```

After that, just use

```bash
flutter run
```

To run on your emulator or connected device, or alternatively run

```bash
flutter build apk
```

To generate an APK to later install on any devices.

Have fun!
